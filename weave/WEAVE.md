# WEAVE Governance Profile
**Version:** v0.1 (Draft)  
**Status:** Living document — designed to evolve without lying about its past. 
**Role under TCA:** Default governance profile under **The Trust Commons Accord (TCA)**.

---

## How to read this

This is one governance profile with **four binding layers**, so we don’t confuse **hard rights** with **soft rituals**:

1. **Core Profile Commitments (Non‑Negotiables within WEAVE)**  
   Applies wherever the WEAVE profile is adopted. If a Node rejects these, it is *outside* the WEAVE profile (and therefore not WEAVE‑governed under TCA).

2. **Safeguards and Due Process (Always On)**  
   Universal protections for individuals and clear paths for complaint, investigation, containment, repair, and appeal.

3. **Charters (Adoptable Modules)**  
   A node/context can adopt one or more charters (Creativity, Provenance, Markets, Competition, etc.).  
   **When adopted, a charter becomes binding** within that node/context.

4. **Rituals and Playbooks (Recommended, Non‑Binding)**  
   Practices that make the culture real (draft nights, audits, lexicon jams). They can change quickly.

This structure combines a high-integrity moral core with modular domain governance.

---

## Position under the Trust Commons Accord (TCA)

The **Trust Commons Accord (TCA)** is the constitutional layer that defines the **non‑negotiable invariants of trust** across meaning, governance, execution, interfaces, and intelligence.

**WEAVE is not the constitution.**  
WEAVE is a **governance profile**: a default, executable way for a community to create legitimacy through *contexts, receipts/outcomes, due process, and earned influence*.

### Relationship to PRISM, NEXUS, CEP, and CEP Praxis

WEAVE assumes (and is designed to work best with):

- **PRISM** for explicit meaning, verifiability levels, and content‑addressed artifacts.
- **NEXUS** (or an equivalent engine) to execute WEAVE contexts and policies over canonical artifacts and derived projections.
- **CEP Substrate** (optional but recommended) to provide deterministic runtime semantics, replayable decision trails, and enforceable security boundaries.
- **CEP Praxis** (optional) as a non‑sovereign intelligence layer that can assist with analysis (e.g., PSA‑style extraction, summaries, triage), without becoming a governor.

### Constitutional compliance rule

When WEAVE is used under TCA:

- WEAVE **MUST** comply with TCA invariants.
- If a WEAVE rule conflicts with TCA, **TCA wins**.
- WEAVE may impose *stricter* requirements than TCA; those are binding for WEAVE‑governed Nodes/Contexts.
---

## Definitions

- **WEAVE**: the default governance profile used by many Trust Commons. Communities and systems that adopt WEAVE interoperate via durable evidence, explicit meaning when needed, and computable credit/consent.
- **Node**: a community (online or offline) that adopts this WEAVE governance profile (typically under TCA) and publishes which Charters it has adopted.
- **Context**: a specific space with its own rules (topic room, project room, market room, match room). Contexts inherit Node rules and may add local parameters.
- **Member**: a participant with rights and duties under this governance profile (and any adopted Charters).
- **Vulnerable**: anyone with meaningfully reduced ability to protect themselves (children, dependents, coerced persons, marginalized groups, the sick/disabled, and beings under our power). 
- **Artifact**: any durable output (claim, summary, policy, creative work, dataset, decision, contract, verdict).
- **Evidence**: receipts, references, logs, replays, provenance manifests, or other durable supports for claims and decisions.

# Part I — Core Commitments of the WEAVE Profile (Non‑Negotiable within WEAVE)

These are the **Bones**. Any Node that openly rejects them is outside WEAVE governance. 

## Article 1 — Reciprocity over extraction
We commit to patterns where people, communities, and environments are not treated as one-way resources.

## Article 2 — Respect for limits
We reject the illusions of:
- a frictionless “Golden Age” where struggle disappears, and
- an “Icarus” overreach where scale and cost are ignored.

We commit to measured change, reversible experiments where possible, and attention to side effects.

## Article 3 — Harm is a tear in the weave
Serious harm (violence, exploitation, betrayal, environmental damage, coercion, major deception):
- must be named (no denial),
- contained (safety first),
- and repaired where possible (restitution, service, structural change).

## Article 4 — Priority care for the vulnerable
We judge our systems first by how they treat the vulnerable.

## Article 5 — Intergenerational responsibility
Short-term advantage does not justify irreversible long-term harm to ecosystems, future communities, or future sentient beings.

## Article 6 — The more‑than‑human has standing
Rivers, forests, species, and other systems affected by our actions must be given a voice through representation when stakes are significant.

## Article 7 — Redemption through repair
When serious harm occurs, repair is required: sustained, concrete work under accountability. Punishment alone is insufficient.

## Article 8 — Plural legitimate paths of heroism
We honor multiple roles: Pathfinder, Weaver/Endurer, Conscience, Repairer, Grieving Negotiator, and others—no single “hero template” dominates.

## Article 9 — Loyal heresy and conscience
Good-faith dissent in service of these Bones must be heard and weighed as an immune response, not treated as automatic betrayal.

## Article 10 — No sacralized cruelty
We reject any doctrine, practice, or ritual that glorifies systematic cruelty, permanently denies basic agency to a class of beings, or treats suffering as holy in itself.

> These Bones are the non-negotiable backbone of this unified governance document.

---

# Part II — Safeguards and Due Process (Always On)

These protections apply in every Node and Context, above local custom.

## Article 11 — Freedom from coercion
- No violence or threat of violence to force belief, membership, obedience, or silence.
- No forced isolation from outside contact.

## Article 12 — Real exit options
- Members may leave at defined cycle boundaries.
- Members may leave immediately if facing serious harm, coercion, or clear violations of the Bones.
- Other Nodes commit to assist safe exit where feasible.

## Article 13 — Protection for children and dependents
- Children and dependents cannot be “vowed” into lifetime commitments by others.
- They must have access to education beyond one doctrine.
- They must have trusted adults they can speak to without retaliation.
- No physical or psychological torture; no total social isolation.

## Article 14 — Right to speak and complain
Any member may raise concerns—locally or to external advocates—without punishment for the act of speaking.

## Article 15 — Privacy with safety override
- Privacy is respected by default.
- Any member retains the right to disclose relevant information to protect the vulnerable or stop ongoing harm.
- Systems should support **graduated disclosure** (e.g., restricted audit access) rather than forcing public exposure. 

## Article 16 — Due process and proportional response
When harms or violations are alleged, the process must be:
1. **Triage** (is anyone in danger right now?)
2. **Containment** (stop ongoing harm; protect vulnerable; preserve evidence)
3. **Investigation** (fair hearing; conflicts-of-interest handled)
4. **Decision** (verdict + rationale + remedy)
5. **Repair** (service/restitution/structural change where possible)
6. **Appeal** (bounded, structured, and non-harassing)

---

# Part III — Governance Structure (Power Checks)

## Article 17 — Nodes, Contexts, and size limits
- Every Node defines a maximum active membership and a split plan to avoid unaccountable mass blocks.
- Contexts must declare their adopted Charters and local parameters. 

## Article 18 — Membership cycles
Membership operates in renewable cycles (default: one year), with clear renewal/transfer/exit rites, and emergency exit for safety.

## Article 19 — The Assembly (federated oversight)
Nodes may federate into an **Assembly** that can:
- hear serious complaints and prophetic warnings,
- coordinate refuge for harmed members,
- set minimum safeguard standards,
- and withdraw recognition from Nodes that violate the Bones. 

## Article 20 — Three currents and the Devil’s Advocate seat
Major decisions must include:
- **Conservative** voices (memory and continuity),
- **Progressive** voices (adaptation and reform),
- **Adversarial/Devil’s Advocate** voices (stress-testing, abuse resistance). 

These roles rotate. No faction owns a role permanently.

## Article 21 — Anti-capture rules
- Term limits for high-power roles.
- Separation of powers: no single person holds spiritual/moral authority, financial control, and justice authority simultaneously. 
- Financial and governance transparency at regular intervals.

## Article 22 — Ombuds and citizen panels
- Independent ombuds receive complaints and can escalate them.
- Periodic random panels review major decisions and serious cases. 

---

# Part IV — Memory, Evidence, and Truthfulness

## Article 23 — Evidence-first governance
Important decisions and high-stakes actions must leave “receipts”:
- what was decided,
- why,
- what evidence was used,
- who participated,
- what dissent existed,
- and what would trigger revision.

This is cultural *and* technical: systems should make it easy to record durable decision trails.

## Article 24 — Determinism where it matters, legibility everywhere
- When decisions are high-impact, systems should support replayable logs of meaningful choices (human or machine) to enable audit and learning.
- When creative or social processes evolve, history should show evolution—not erase it.

## Article 25 — No “clean history” fraud
We do not rewrite the past to protect status. We may redact sensitive details, but we keep truthful records and rationale trails.

---

## Article 26 — Accountable automation and AI agency (TCA‑aligned)

Automation can assist, but it cannot be allowed to create deniable power.

- **Human Commons authorship rule:** In Human‑facing contexts, any AI‑authored *claim* or other canonical artifact MUST be submitted under an accountable **human principal** (or accountable organization role) who explicitly authorizes the write. If no such authorization exists, the write MUST be aborted before publication.
- **Provenance and method identity:** AI‑assisted artifacts SHOULD include method identity (tool/model/version) and a note on nondeterminism, so later reviewers can reason about reliability and replay.
- **No auto‑legitimacy:** AI outputs may be stored as drafts/proposals, but MUST NOT be treated as “admitted” or “settled” without governance action (receipts/outcomes) appropriate to the context.

## Article 27 — Delicate knowledge, secrecy, and “can’t‑unsee” access

Some information cannot be safely made default‑visible or default‑learnable.

- Contexts MUST support declaring **sensitivity** (e.g., private / restricted / delicate / secret / can’t‑unsee) at least at the context level and, when feasible, at the artifact/evidence level.
- Access to delicate/secret/can’t‑unsee material by automated agents SHOULD require an explicit, purpose‑bound authorization (e.g., a **Sealed Access Dossier**) that binds scope, duration, non‑retention, non‑federation, and auditability obligations.
- Systems SHOULD support **graduated disclosure**: public summaries and redacted receipts where appropriate, with protected deep records for legitimate audits.
- Redaction is allowed to protect the vulnerable and prevent doxxing, but “clean history” is not: rationale trails and the existence of decisions must remain visible.

---

# Part V — Adoptable Charters (Binding When Adopted)

Each Node/Context publishes which charters it adopts.  
A charter can be adopted **as-written** or as a **versioned fork**, but forks must declare differences clearly.

---

## Charter A — Creativity and Brave Learning
**Purpose:** Build a culture that rewards disciplined exploration and “learning with receipts.”

### Commitments (when adopted)
1. **The attempt has dignity.**
2. **We reward learning, not just winning.**
3. **Make the work legible** (drafts, logs, prototypes, rehearsal takes, experiment notes).
4. **Protect the explorer** (no shaming sincere attempts; psychological safety).
5. **Small bets first** (bounded risk; test small, learn fast).
6. **Credit follows contribution** (including early sketches and honest negative results).
7. **Share the trail when safe** (learning as infrastructure).
8. **Stop is a skill** (celebrate stopping well).
9. **Creators deserve leverage** (ownership, attribution, bargaining power).
10. **Integrity is the price of admission** (no performative failure; no faked learning).

### The Creator’s Oath (optional, but recommended)
> I will try boldly, test honestly, and share what I learn.  
> I will not fake results, and I will not shame sincere attempts.  
> I will return from the unknown with something useful—  
> even if it’s only the truth that this path doesn’t work.

---

## Charter B — Truth, Determinism, and Replayability
**Purpose:** Make the past observable and repeatable where it matters, so we can learn without mythmaking. 

### Commitments (when adopted)
- **Evidence-first:** meaningful choices are written down.
- **Encapsulation-first:** learning and power must be bounded by membranes/roles; no raw-state leakage.
- **Decision logging for nondeterminism:** when a choice could vary, log it.
- **Replay for accountability:** audits and incident reviews can replay decision paths.
- **Budgets and capability boundaries:** influence/compute/reach are limited and explicitly granted.

### Governance implication
Charter B contexts should treat changes as **versioned reforms** with rollback plans and evidence gates. 

---

## Charter C — Meaning, Semantics, and Interoperability
**Purpose:** Make ambiguity optional. Use explicit meaning when coordination, contracts, or disputes require it.

### Commitments (when adopted)
- Contexts declare a **Meaning Strictness Level** (inspired by Prism Compliance Levels):
  - **M0:** free text
  - **M1:** annotated meaning (advisory tags)
  - **M2:** strict grounded meaning (definitions resolve to a shared lexicon)
  - **M3:** template-validated meaning for contracts and critical procedures  
- Communities maintain **versioned lexicons** for key terms and disputes.
- When disputes recur, define terms explicitly rather than re-litigating hidden definitions.

### Safety rule
Meaning strictness must never be used to silence the vulnerable; it’s a tool for clarity, not gatekeeping.

---

## Charter D — Provenance, Credit, and Rights
**Purpose:** Make authorship, consent, licensing, and process durable—without forcing creators to surrender privacy.

### Commitments (when adopted)
- **Intent-first and seed-first** creation lanes for “original work” claims.
- Publish a **Provenance Manifest** (at minimum: tool/model used, seed presence, and licensing posture).
- Support **two-layer transparency**:
  - public “nutrition label”
  - private deep record (encrypted)
- Support **commit–reveal** options for sensitive prompts/inputs to preserve auditability without forced disclosure.
- Enforce **license compatibility checks** at publish time where applicable.

### Credit rule
Credit follows contribution across forks/merges, with clear attribution and consent boundaries.

---

## Charter E — People, Trust, and No Cheap Influence
**Purpose:** Make influence earned, scoped, and resistant to capture by spam, mobs, or automation.  

### Commitments (when adopted)
- **Version everything** (claims, positions, summaries, policies).
- **Separate agreement from trust from quality** (“I disagree” ≠ “you are bad”).
- **Scoped trust** (by topic/domain/game category), not one global score.
- **Budgets for influence actions** (endorsements, outreach, challenges) to prevent cheap mass manipulation.
- **Right to doubt, not right to harass**: disputes are structured, rate-limited, and abuse is penalized.
- **Forkability**: communities can fork data and governance if captured.

---

## Charter F — Commons Knowledge Production
**Purpose:** Turn conversation into durable knowledge without requiring everyone to write essays.

### Commitments (when adopted)
- Extract **claims** from conversation.
- Attach **evidence** and **positions** (support/oppose/conditional/uncertain).
- Produce **living artifacts** (summaries, decision logs, FAQs, argument maps) with version history.
- Provide “raw view” and “trust-weighted view” side-by-side for transparency.

---

## Charter G — Markets and Consentful Matching
**Purpose:** Replace broadcast spam with consentful discovery and accountable deals. 

### Commitments (when adopted)
- Users opt into being contacted; providers cannot mass-spam.
- Provider outreach costs budget and/or stake; deception can be penalized.
- Deals produce durable outcomes (delivered/disputed/etc.) that update trust. 

---

## Charter H — Competition, Integrity, and Fair Play
**Purpose:** Enable credible competition where integrity is first-class and disputes don’t become witch hunts.

### Commitments (when adopted)
- Matches generate **evidence dossiers** where appropriate.
- Integrity challenges are structured, private by default, rate-limited, and adjudicated.
- Accurate challengers gain standing; frivolous harassment is penalized.
- “Inconclusive” outcomes are allowed (not every dispute becomes punishment).  

---

## Charter I — Experiments, Pilots, and the Mature Risk Zone
**Purpose:** Allow bold evolution without denial of tragedy, with tripwires and refuge when things go wrong.

### Commitments (when adopted)
- Experiments are named as such (scope, duration, risks, affected parties).
- No involuntary test subjects—especially children, dependents, or low-power members.
- Experiments define **tripwires** (conditions that halt or roll back).
- Failed pilots must produce **lessons** (archives and warnings), not scapegoats. 

---

## Charter J — More‑Than‑Human Stewardship
**Purpose:** Give standing to ecosystems and non-human stakeholders affected by our actions.

### Commitments (when adopted)
- Appoint advocates or roles to represent more‑than‑human interests in relevant decisions.
- Treat irreversible ecological harm as a high-severity violation requiring containment and repair plans.
- Teach members how to reason about long-horizon stewardship and “debts forward.” 

---

## Charter K — Justice and Healing Skills
**Purpose:** Make justice and healing trainable skills, not vibes, and institutionalize repair paths.

### Commitments (when adopted)
- Run justice scenario drills at least once per cycle.
- Maintain trained roles for harm-handling (ombuds, devil’s advocate, and optionally healer/justice specialists).
- Provide repair paths (service, restitution, structural changes) with accountability.

---

# Part VI — Recommended Rituals and Playbooks (Non‑Binding)

These are strongly recommended defaults. Nodes may adopt, fork, or replace them.

## A. Creativity Rituals (Charter A playbook)
- **Trail Log (weekly, 10 minutes):** what I tried, expected, learned, next step. 
- **Draft Night (recurring):** share unfinished work with kind, specific growth feedback. 
- **Good Stop Award (monthly):** celebrate stopping a bad direction because evidence said so. 
- **Negative Results Library:** “Tried this; didn’t work; here’s why.” 
- **Two-Scores Review:** process score + outcome score.

## B. Governance Rituals (Core playbook)
- **Annual Rite of Confession & Complaint** (per Node): structured naming of harms and failures without retaliation.
- **Great Audits** (every ~7 cycles): external reviewers + refugees + random members give candid reports.
- **Warnings Pack Review:** curate and discuss anonymized cases of harm, failed experiments, and repairs.

## C. Evidence and Systems Rituals (Charter B playbook)
- **Decision Review Day:** sample high-impact decisions and check “receipts” quality.
- **Replay Drill:** practice reconstructing an incident from logs and producing a public postmortem (with redactions as needed).

## D. Meaning Rituals (Charter C playbook)
- **Lexicon Jam:** once per cycle, define the top 10 disputed terms and publish scoped definitions.
- **Ambiguity Budget:** contexts choose where ambiguity is allowed (creative play) and where strictness is required (contracts/safety).

## E. Provenance Rituals (Charter D playbook)
- **Provenance Clinic:** help creators upgrade a project’s nutrition label + rights binder.
- **Attribution Day:** review forks/merges and ensure credit propagation is accurate.  

## F. Trust Rituals (Charter E playbook)
- **Calibration Week:** periodically compare raw activity vs trust-weighted influence, publish explanations, tune budgets.
- **Challenge Hygiene Drill:** teach “right to doubt” without harassment; practice filing structured challenges.

---

# Part VII — Enforcement, Remedies, and Appeals

## Severity levels
- **Level 0 — Disagreement:** normal conflict; handled by debate and evidence.
- **Level 1 — Misconduct:** harassment, spam, repeated bad faith; sanctions proportional.
- **Level 2 — Serious harm:** coercion, exploitation, credible threats, severe deception, child endangerment; immediate containment.
- **Level 3 — Bone violation:** sacralized cruelty, systematic exploitation, coverups; Assembly-level response and possible expulsion.

## Standard remedies menu (choose proportionally)
- Education / warning
- Rate limits / capability reduction / temporary suspension
- Loss of roles or leadership authority
- Required restitution and repair plans (“Heracles path”)
- Separation / expulsion from a Context or Node
- Cross-node warnings when necessary for safety (especially for severe repeated harms) 

## Appeals
Appeals are allowed but bounded:
- limited frequency,
- clear grounds,
- and no harassment of complainants, witnesses, or reviewers.

---

# Part VIII — Amendment and Versioning

## Amendment scopes
1. **Bones (Articles 1–10):**  
   Highest threshold, slow cadence. Requires broad consent across conservative/progressive/adversarial currents and strong evidence that change better protects the vulnerable and long-horizon flourishing.  

2. **Safeguards and Due Process (Articles 11–16):**  
   High threshold; must not weaken vulnerable protection.

3. **Charters:**  
   Modular; can be adopted, forked, versioned, and improved faster. Forks must publish diffs.

4. **Rituals/Playbooks:**  
   Fast iteration; change as needed.

## History rule
All amendments must preserve:
- prior versions,
- change logs,
- and rationale trails (no “clean history”). 

---

# Appendix — Adoption Declarations (Templates)

## A. Node Declaration (minimum)
- Node name
- Adopted **TCA** version
- Adopted **WEAVE Governance Profile** version
- Adopted Charters (with versions)
- Membership cycle definition
- Ombuds contact method
- Emergency exit process

## B. Context Declaration (minimum)
- Context name and purpose
- Required/optional Charters
- Meaning strictness level (M0–M3)
- Influence budgets (endorsements/outreach/challenges)

---

## Closing
This governance profile aims to make communities and systems that can:
- explore without lying,
- disagree without cruelty,
- create with credit and consent,
- coordinate without cheap influence,
- and repair when harm happens.

It will be judged not by rhetoric, but by whether it produces **livable, corrigible, humane worlds**.

---

# Addendum — Corruption, Negotiation, Minimum Node Formation, and Harm‑Response Constellations
**Applies to:** *WEAVE Governance Profile* (v0.1 Draft)  
**Addendum ID:** v0.1‑A (Draft)  
**Status:** This addendum is binding **when adopted** by a Node/Context or ratified by an Assembly. It does not weaken the Bones; it clarifies implementation details.

---

## 0) Intent and placement

This addendum clarifies and extends:

- **Part II (Safeguards and Due Process)** — especially Articles 11–16.
- **Article 17 (Nodes, Contexts, and size limits)** — by adding minimum formation stages.
- **Part IV (Evidence‑first governance)** — by specifying receipts/tripwires for negotiation and repair.
- **Charter C (Meaning Strictness)** — by specifying minimum M‑levels for high‑impact agreements.
- **Charter K (Justice and Healing Skills)** — by defining these skills and replacing “single‑archetype specialist” framing with a multi‑archetypical constellation model.

This addendum introduces two new concepts central to enforcement and culture:
- **Corruption** (a failure mode with recognizable signatures), and
- the **Mature Risk Zone** (MRZ), the safe “risk‑taking” zone that allows experimentation without moral distortion.

---

## 1) Added definitions (for v0.1)

### 1.1 Corruption
**Corruption** is a sustained pattern where a person, role, or institution:
- causes **systematic damage to long‑term flourishing**,  
- while claiming to serve flourishing,  
- and **distorts moral language** to hide or justify the damage,  
- and **blocks, punishes, or evades correction**.

A compact test: **repeated misalignment + self‑deception + resistance to correction**.

Corruption is not “having mixed motives” or “making a hard tradeoff.” It is the degradation of truthfulness and accountability around harm.

### 1.2 The Mature Risk Zone (MRZ)
The **Mature Risk Zone** is the domain of legitimate experimentation and hard tradeoffs where:
- information is incomplete,
- motives are mixed,
- costs are real,
- and outcomes are uncertain,

**but** the parties remain:
- honest about tradeoffs and harms,
- committed to safeguards,
- open to feedback, repair, and revision,
- and willing to stop or change course when evidence warrants.

When MRZ conditions fail—especially when harm is minimized/hidden and correction is punished—the process has crossed into **corruption proper**.

### 1.3 Justice (skill)
**Justice** is a trainable capacity to:
1) **Notice** patterns of harm, exploitation, intimidation, or cruelty;  
2) **Discern** whether a situation is within the MRZ or drifting into corruption;  
3) **Respond proportionately**, escalating as needed (conversation → mediation/ombuds → Assembly review → external authorities when warranted), while protecting the vulnerable.

Justice is not synonymous with punishment. Its primary functions are protection, proportionality, and legitimacy.

### 1.4 Healing (skill)
**Healing** is a trainable capacity to:
- create safety for the hurt,
- hold pain/grief/anger/shame without denial or premature closure,
- support **real repair** where possible,
- or support **healthy separation** where repair is not possible,
- while refusing sacralized cruelty and preserving the priority care of the vulnerable.

Healing does not replace justice; it makes repair/separation psychologically and socially possible without coercion or denial.

### 1.5 Negotiation
**Negotiation** is a structured attempt to reach a voluntary commitment among parties with partly competing needs,
**only within the MRZ**, by making tradeoffs explicit, preserving real exit, and producing verifiable “receipts” when stakes are high.

Negotiation is a coordination tool. It must not become a mechanism for hiding harm, coercing silence, or bypassing due process.

### 1.6 Tripwire
A **tripwire** is a pre‑committed condition that triggers review, renegotiation, containment, or escalation (e.g., “if X happens, we pause the agreement and invoke the dispute process”).

Tripwires are mandatory in high‑impact agreements.

### 1.7 Node Proposal, Seed Cell, Recognized Node
- **Node Proposal (1 person):** a public (or appropriately scoped) declaration of intent and invitation. It is *not* a Node.
- **Seed Cell / Dyad Pilot (2 people):** a time‑bounded pilot relationship operating under a host’s governance. It is *not* a fully recognized Node.
- **Recognized Node (3+ people):** a Node eligible to self‑govern under v0.1, provided required declarations and safeguards are in place.

### 1.8 Host Node / Incubator
A **Host Node** (or **Incubator**) is a recognized Node (or infrastructure body) that:
- hosts Proposals and Seed Cells as Contexts,
- provides complaint intake and independent process (ombuds/mediation),
- and ensures required receipts and escalation routes exist.

---

## 2) Corruption vs MRZ: operational rules

### 2.1 The MRZ permission test (for any high‑stakes coordination)
A negotiation, repair plan, or pilot is within MRZ only if all are true:
1) **Safeguards remain intact** (no coercion; real exit; right to complain).  
2) **Harms and tradeoffs are named** (not minimized or hidden).  
3) **Correction is safe** (dissent/complaint is not punished).  
4) **Receipts exist** for high‑impact actions.  
5) **Tripwires exist** and can be invoked without retaliation.

If (2) or (3) fails, treat the situation as **corruption risk** and shift from negotiation to justice/containment.

### 2.2 Corruption indicators (non‑exhaustive)
Warning signs requiring escalation:
- “Don’t put that in writing” around safety, money, power, or harm.
- Complainants/witnesses are threatened, shamed, exiled, or punished.
- Safeguards are bypassed “for the mission,” repeatedly.
- The group’s moral language becomes performative cover for harm.
- Independent review is blocked, delayed indefinitely, or delegitimized.

### 2.3 Non‑negotiables
Nothing in MRZ allows:
- coercion or forced isolation (Article 11),
- removing real exit (Article 12),
- retaliating against complaint (Article 14),
- suppressing safety disclosures (Article 15 safety override),
- bypassing due process for serious harms (Article 16).

---

## 3) Negotiation and settlement protocol (Weave‑aligned)

### 3.1 Scope
Negotiation is appropriate for:
- coordination problems,
- resource allocations,
- boundary and role setting,
- repair agreements **after** containment,
- and experiments/pilots within MRZ.

Negotiation is inappropriate for:
- situations with ongoing coercion or unsafe power asymmetry,
- “settlements” that require silence about safety‑relevant harm,
- bypassing due process where serious harms are alleged.

### 3.2 Meaning strictness requirements (Charter C)
For agreements:
- **M0/M1** may be used for low‑stakes exploration and informal coordination.
- **M2** is recommended when disputes recur or definitions matter.
- **M3 is REQUIRED** for high‑impact commitments (money, housing, caregiving, sexual ethics, authority/discipline, sanctions, long‑term vows, or safety‑critical procedures).

Meaning strictness must never be used to silence the vulnerable.

### 3.3 Receipts (evidence‑first governance)
For **high‑impact** negotiated outcomes, produce durable receipts including:
- what was decided,
- who participated (or roles, if privacy requires),
- rationale and tradeoffs,
- evidence/inputs used,
- dissent recorded (if any),
- enforcement/verification method,
- **tripwires** and revision triggers,
- how to file a doubt/challenge without harassment,
- and the escalation route (ombuds / Assembly / external).

### 3.4 Tripwires and revision
Every high‑impact agreement must specify:
- what triggers pause/review,
- who can invoke it,
- what temporary containment happens during review,
- and a time‑bound process for revision.

Invoking a tripwire is protected speech (no retaliation).

### 3.5 Prohibited logic: “tit‑for‑tat retaliation rights”
Nodes and Contexts must not formalize “mutual retaliation rights” as a governance method.
Disputes use **pause → separate → escalate** (see §6.3) and proportional due process (Article 16).

---

## 4) Justice and Healing Skills (expanded Charter K guidance)

### 4.1 Two linked skills, two distinct jobs
- **Justice** decides what must happen to stop harm and restore legitimacy.
- **Healing** enables repair or separation without denial, coercion, or sacralized cruelty.

They operate in parallel; neither is a substitute for the other.

### 4.2 Three layers of healing competence
Nodes should cultivate:
1) **Inner literacy:** self‑regulation, boundaries, knowing when to step back from mediation.
2) **Relational healing:** listening, apology, repair dialogue, mediation and de‑escalation.
3) **Structural healing:** designing repair paths; guiding groups through confession/change; supporting healthy separation.

### 4.3 Justice competence expectations
Trained justice capacity includes:
- MRZ vs corruption discernment,
- protection of complainants/witnesses,
- proportional response and escalation,
- conflict‑of‑interest handling,
- and repair accountability (service/restitution/structural change).

### 4.4 Training and drills (minimum)
When Charter K is adopted, a Node SHOULD:
- run scenario drills at least once per membership cycle,
- maintain at least one trained complaint intake path (ombuds or hosted ombuds),
- maintain templates for repair agreements (M3),
- and maintain a “warnings pack” of anonymized lessons learned.

---

## 5) Harm‑Response Constellations (multi‑archetypical replacement for single‑hero specialist roles)

### 5.1 Principle

Nodes may still train deep specialists, but authority is exercised through **rotating hats** and contestable process, not through a permanent archetype.
High‑trust harm response must not concentrate into a single identity archetype.  
Instead, Nodes use a **Harm‑Response Constellation**: a rotating set of roles (“hats”) assigned per case.

### 5.2 Structure
A Constellation is:
- **not a rank**,
- **not permanent ownership** of authority,
- **case‑scoped** and **rotating**,
- accountable to due process and review,
- removable for abuse, bias, or capture.

### 5.3 Suggested roles (Nodes may rename, extend, or fork)
Minimum recommended “hats” (may be held by different people or borrowed externally):
- **Ombuds / Listener** — intake, safety planning, routing.
- **Devil’s Advocate** — stress‑tests and anti‑abuse review.
- **Mediator / De‑escalator** — relational stabilization when appropriate.
- **Protection Steward** — ensures vulnerable‑first containment and exit support.
- **Repair Designer** — drafts repair plans with verification.
- **Archivist / Keeper of Threads** — ensures receipts and memory without “clean history” fraud.

### 5.4 Conflict‑of‑interest and recusal
No one may serve in a Constellation role on a case where they:
- are a primary party,
- have direct dependency ties that bias process,
- or have incentives that would reasonably undermine trust.

Recusal is a protected action.

### 5.5 Small‑node compatibility
Nodes under 5 people SHOULD borrow Constellation roles from:
- their Host Node / Incubator, or
- a peer node’s rotating support pool,
to preserve independence.

## 6) Minimum node formation: proposals, seed cells, and recognition

This section extends Article 17 (size limits) by defining the *floor* for legitimacy.

### 6.1 Stage 0 — Node Proposal (1 person)
A Node Proposal MUST publish (scoped appropriately):
- purpose and scope (“what we are exploring / not exploring”),
- intended adopted WEAVE profile version and charters (if any),
- **quit channels** and exit expectations,
- initial boundaries and risk declaration,
- intended meaning strictness for commitments,
- how receipts will be kept for high‑impact actions,
- and the external escalation route (who to contact if harm occurs).

A Node Proposal MUST NOT claim to provide internal due process, independent review, or ombuds independence.

### 6.2 Stage 1 — Seed Cell / Dyad Pilot (2 people)
A two‑person community is structurally high‑risk for coercion and “your word vs mine” collapse.
Therefore a dyad MAY operate only as a **Seed Cell** under these constraints:

**A) External anchoring is REQUIRED**
A Seed Cell must be hosted as a Context by a Host Node / Incubator that provides:
- complaint intake,
- independent mediation/ombuds,
- and escalation routing.

**B) A Seed Cell Declaration is REQUIRED**
It must include:
- purpose and duration (time‑bounded by default),
- exit rules and immediate safety exit,
- meaning strictness requirements (M3 for high‑impact),
- receipts policy for high‑impact actions,
- and the host’s escalation contacts/process.

**C) Authority limits (until 3+ members)**
A Seed Cell MUST NOT:
- take dependent children under its authority as a “node,”
- require isolation from outside contact,
- impose internal punishments or “discipline,”
- make irreversible pooled‑asset commitments above a declared threshold without host‑witnessed M3 receipts,
- handle serious harm allegations internally beyond triage/containment.

### 6.3 Seed Cell dispute default: pause → separate → escalate
In a dyad, disputes MUST default to:
1) **Pause** the contested behavior and stabilize safety.
2) **Separate** (physical/digital distance; protect exit).
3) **Escalate** to the host ombuds/mediator for investigation/decision/repair routing.

### 6.4 Stage 2 — Recognized Node (3+ people)
A Node becomes recognized at **3 or more** members when it:
- publishes a Node Declaration (per WCIC / local equivalent),
- names its ombuds/complaint intake route,
- adopts a due process pipeline (Article 16),
- sets a maximum membership and split plan (Article 17),
- and commits to evidence‑first receipts for high‑impact decisions (Part IV).

### 6.5 Graduation and recognition withdrawal
Host Nodes / Assemblies MAY:
- graduate a Seed Cell to a Recognized Node when criteria are met,
- or withdraw hosting/recognition when safeguards or Bones are violated.

## 7) Compatibility notes

- This addendum does not alter the Bones; it clarifies how to protect them during negotiation and node formation.
- Where v0.1 is silent on corruption, this addendum supplies operational definitions and triggers.
- Where v0.1 names “healer/justice specialists” broadly, this addendum recommends the **Constellation** model to reduce capture and single‑archetype dependence.

# Addendum — Tissue Governance, Evolution, and Plural Local Institutions (Including Markets)
**Applies to:** *WEAVE Governance Profile* (v0.1 Draft)  
**Addendum ID:** v0.1‑B (Draft)  
**Status:** Binding **when adopted** by a Node/Context or ratified by an Assembly.

---

## 0) Purpose

This addendum clarifies how WEAVE can:

1) evolve **without a central “head”**,  
2) host **many local institutional governments** per Node (democracy, meritocracy, councils, autocracy, tradition-based roles, etc.),  
3) remain constitutional through **invariants + due process + evidence**, and  
4) host **markets** as *Contexts* without letting markets define the whole.

This addendum is written to preserve the spirit of the WEAVE profile (and its TCA alignment):
- the **Bones** remain non‑negotiable, and  
- evolution happens through **records, signals, and repair**, not through conquest, charisma, or “clean-history” mythology.

---

## 1) New definitions

### 1.1 Tissue governance
**Tissue governance** is a mode of collective life where:
- Nodes are **sovereign explorers** (local autonomy by default), and  
- the federation exists primarily as an **immune + memory + interoperability layer**, not as a command hierarchy.

### 1.2 Governance Interface
A **Governance Interface** (also called a *Governance Signature* or *Civic Profile*) is the minimal, published description of **how a Node’s institutions function** in ways that matter for trust safety and interoperability under TCA.

It is **not** the Node’s full culture or ideology. It is the “observable contract” that allows other Nodes to understand:
- who has what power,
- how that power is constrained,
- how harm is handled,
- how exit works,
- and what records exist for high-impact actions.

### 1.3 Local institutional government
A **local institutional government** is any Node-chosen internal system for making decisions and assigning authority (e.g., democracy, meritocracy, councils, traditions, hierarchy, autocratic pilots, etc.).

Local institutions are permitted **so long as they do not violate TCA invariants or WEAVE core commitments**.

### 1.4 Market Context
A **Market Context** is a Context that coordinates exchange (goods, services, attention, matching, labor, credit, reputation) using market mechanisms (prices, auctions, bids, offers, contracts, and/or other incentive structures).

Markets are allowed as **Contexts**, not as the constitutional source of truth.

### 1.5 Market Grammar
A **Market Grammar** is the market-specific analogue of a Governance Interface: a published, inspectable specification of:
- what can be exchanged,
- what consent means inside the market,
- what counts as a valid offer/contract,
- how disputes are resolved,
- what receipts are mandatory,
- how exit/unwind works,
- and how externalities are signaled.

### 1.6 Signals
**Signals** are multi-channel indicators of system functioning and pathology (e.g., complaint safety, exit friction, repair completion, retaliation rates, evidence quality), not a single mood or popularity score.

---

## 2) Governance pluralism: many governments, one trust constitution

### 2.1 Sovereignty inside invariants
Each Node may choose any local institutional government, including culturally distinctive or experimental forms, **provided** that:

- the Bones are upheld, and  
- Safeguards and Due Process remain “always on.”

No local government may override:
- freedom from coercion,
- real exit options,
- protection for children/dependents,
- the right to speak and complain without retaliation,
- privacy with safety override,
- or due process for serious harms.

### 2.2 Required publication: the Governance Interface
To be recognized as a WEAVE‑governed Node under TCA, a Node MUST publish a Governance Interface (scoped to preserve privacy when needed) containing:

1) **Decision domains**  
   (e.g., membership, finance/assets, housing/resources, doctrine/ritual, safety, discipline/sanctions, partnerships, external relations).

2) **Authority map**  
   who decides each domain (whole membership, council, appointed leader, elders, merit board, rotating stewards, etc.).

3) **Decision rules**  
   how decisions are made (consensus, vote, delegated authority, consultation + leader decision, etc.), including thresholds for high-impact actions.

4) **Accountability and removal**  
   how high-power roles are selected, reviewed, and removed; term limits if present; conflict-of-interest and recusal rules.

5) **Complaint intake and routing**  
   how a member reports harm safely; how escalation works; how retaliation is prevented.

6) **Due process binding**  
   how the Node implements triage → containment → investigation → decision → repair → appeal.

7) **Exit and unwind**  
   how members leave at cycle boundaries; how emergency exit works; how shared assets/roles/housing unwind.

8) **Receipts and meaning strictness**  
   what counts as “high impact” locally; where receipts live; minimum meaning strictness for high-impact commitments (contracts, sanctions, safety-critical choices).

### 2.3 High-asymmetry governments
Some institutional forms concentrate decision power (e.g., autocracy, strong hierarchies, patriarchies/matriarchies, hereditary leadership, strict merit gatekeeping). These are **not banned**, but they are structurally higher-risk for coercion and silencing.

Nodes using high-asymmetry governments MUST add these safeguards to their Governance Interface:

- **External complaint path** available without internal permission,
- **Stricter receipts scope** (more actions treated as high-impact),
- **Accelerated safe exit** (including refuge routing),
- **Periodic independent review** (by ombuds pool, peer node, or random panel),
- Clear limits on authority over bodies, relationships, outside contact, and dependents.

### 2.4 Interoperability promise
A Node’s sovereignty is respected. But federation-level cooperation depends on each Node being legible and contestable through its Governance Interface.

---

## 3) Weave-wide decision-making without a head

The Weave evolves through **three decision modes**. This keeps the tissue adaptive while preventing central domination.

### 3.1 Mode A — Adoption-by-use (default)
Most “Weave changes” are not commands. They are **standards, playbooks, templates, and protocols** published as versioned artifacts.

Nodes adopt them voluntarily. Successful patterns spread by imitation and interoperability.

### 3.2 Mode B — Stewardship of shared infrastructure (bounded authority)
Some shared systems exist for the health of the whole (refuge routing, ombuds pools, archives, registries, standards indexes).

These are governed by **Steward Groups** that MUST be:
- limited in scope (no general rule over Nodes),
- rotating and removable,
- receipt-producing and auditable,
- constrained by the Bones and Safeguards.

Stewards are maintainers, not rulers.

### 3.3 Mode C — Core profile change (rare and slow)
Changes that modify WEAVE core commitments/safeguards (and must remain TCA‑compliant) require:
- a structured proposal,
- evidence from trials where appropriate,
- independent review,
- high thresholds,
- and a cooling-off window.

No single Node or faction can “win” a constitutional change by speed, scale, or force.

---

## 4) The Weave Evolution Protocol (evidence-gated change)

### 4.1 The Proposal Registry
The Weave maintains a registry of proposed standards and reforms. Each proposal MUST include:

- what it changes (charter, protocol, interface standard, or invariant),
- motivation and failure mode analysis,
- a test plan (including scenario categories),
- risks (especially coercion/retaliation/exit risks),
- mandatory receipts,
- tripwires and rollback conditions.

### 4.2 Trials (opt-in, bounded, reversible where possible)
Nodes may opt into trials, with:
- explicit scope and duration,
- no involuntary test subjects (especially children/dependents/low-power members),
- tripwires that halt or roll back the trial,
- and a commitment to publish lessons learned (with redactions when needed).

### 4.3 Evidence Packets
Nodes participating in a trial produce Evidence Packets containing:

- the Node’s Governance Interface summary (so governance context is known),
- what exactly was adopted (version),
- which scenario categories were encountered,
- outcomes and adverse events,
- receipts for high-impact decisions,
- and a postmortem: what worked, what failed, what changed.

### 4.4 Review Swarm
A rotating review body (including adversarial reviewers) synthesizes evidence across Nodes and publishes:

- what appears to generalize,
- what fails and for whom,
- gaming risks,
- minority harm risks,
- and recommended scope of adoption.

### 4.5 Recommendation labels
Standards/protocols may be labeled:
- **Experimental** (early; insufficient evidence),
- **Provisional** (promising; limited replications),
- **Recommended** (multiple independent replications; harms bounded),
- **Stable** (tested through time and stress),
- **Deprecated** (harmful, superseded, or too gameable).

These labels guide adoption without coercion.

---

## 5) Signals and scenario harness (functioning over power)

### 5.1 Scenario harness
The Weave may maintain a shared suite of “scenario categories” used to compare outcomes across different institutional forms (without forcing uniform culture). Examples:

- complaint against leadership,
- member exit with shared resources,
- power asymmetry (newcomer vs founder),
- internal conflict with credible harm claim,
- resource scarcity shock,
- rapid growth onboarding,
- cross-node dispute,
- infiltration/capture attempt.

Nodes map real events into scenario categories and publish evidence packets (with privacy-preserving redactions when required).

### 5.2 Multi-signal scorecard (not a single number)
To avoid metric capture, the Weave uses a **multi-signal scorecard** rather than a single “happiness” or “success” score.

Recommended signal families:

- **Complaint safety:** retaliation rate, channel availability, time to safe intake.
- **Exit health:** exit friction, unwind time, post-exit retaliation signals.
- **Justice/repair performance:** time to containment, resolution time, repair completion, repeat harm.
- **Legibility:** receipts coverage for high-impact actions, audit pass rate.
- **Vulnerability protection:** subgroup safety/fear indices; minority distress cannot be averaged away.
- **Externalities:** harm exported to other nodes/contexts; dispute spillover.
- **Resilience:** ability to admit error, revise, and stop harmful experiments.

### 5.3 What signals are allowed to do
Signals may be used to:
- identify “reference implementations” worth copying,
- qualify nodes/contexts to steward shared infrastructure,
- weight the credibility of evidence packets,
- trigger supportive interventions (training, mediation resources),
- trigger audits or Assembly attention when pathology indicators rise.

Signals MUST NOT be used to:
- trap members,
- punish truthful reporting,
- grant coercive authority over other nodes,
- or erase minority harm under majority satisfaction.

---

## 6) Node size: responsibility increases, not authority

### 6.1 Size does not grant steering power
In tissue governance, Node size MUST NOT automatically grant:
- more authority over Weave evolution,
- more right to define standards,
- or the power to force adoption on others.

### 6.2 Size changes scrutiny and obligations
Larger Nodes may:
- produce higher-confidence evidence (larger sample size),
- but also face higher scrutiny due to larger externalities and higher capture risk.

Scale increases **responsibility**, not sovereignty over others.

---

## 7) Markets as contexts inside the tissue

### 7.1 Markets are welcome, bounded, and inspectable
Nodes may host markets as Contexts (including labor markets, matching, auctions, and exchange) provided that markets:

- preserve real exit (no traps),
- preserve complaint without retaliation,
- preserve due process for serious disputes,
- respect privacy with safety override,
- and produce receipts for high-impact deals.

Markets may optimize allocation; they may not override the Bones.

### 7.2 Market Grammar (required for Market Contexts)
Any Market Context MUST publish a Market Grammar describing:

1) **Scope of exchange** (what is tradable; what is prohibited).  
2) **Consent rules** (who may contact whom; opt-in discovery; anti-spam budgets).  
3) **Contract forms** (what counts as a binding commitment; required clauses).  
4) **Receipts** (mandatory fields: terms, duration, unwind, verification, dispute route).  
5) **Dispute handling** (mediation/ombuds routing; escalation for fraud/coercion).  
6) **Exit/unwind** (cooling-off windows where appropriate; reversible commitments when feasible).  
7) **Externality signaling** (how harms to non-participants are surfaced and addressed).  
8) **Anti-capture constraints** (concentration monitoring; stake/budget limits on outreach/influence).

### 7.3 Price is a signal, not a verdict
Markets may use price and reputation as signals, but Weave governance treats them as **partial indicators** that must be interpreted alongside safety, exit, complaint, and externality signals.

A profitable market that produces coercion, retaliation, or hidden harm is constitutionally failing.

---

## 8) Adoption and compatibility

### 8.1 Adoption by Nodes/Contexts
A Node or Context may adopt this addendum as written or as a versioned fork. Forks MUST declare differences clearly and cannot remove constitutional invariants.

### 8.2 Non-conflict clause
Nothing in this addendum reduces the force of:
- the Bones,
- Safeguards and Due Process,
- or Evidence-first governance.

This addendum clarifies how plural institutions can exist while remaining compatible with the Weave’s constitutional intent.
